2/3/2013,"I was in Sydney staying at Madeline's house but the house was also Lynn's house in NY. I was about to get on a plane, home to Melbourne, but realized that I had not organised what to do with my car and all of my stuff (of which there was a lot of). It then occurred to me I could drive home along the Hume but I was too scared to drive alone and then a man appeared, a young guy and he said he'd drive back with me to Melbourne. I was relieved, I forfeited my flight, and realized I could put everything in side of my car and drive home.....Lynn was pissed off, that I had not organised myself properly or told her I was moving out, I was happy to leave and be heading home.",#ff3300,user1@test.com
2/3/2013,"I was in a huge shallow pool in a giant dimly lit circus tent.   There were seal/walrus type creatures that were passing candy-striped beach balls to each other off their snouts.    In a canyon, it was bright daylight, there was a waterfall and I was with our dream group.   We were planning to kayak, and everyone was wearing brightly coloured candystriped clothing.  I was about to be launched into the water, the people who were going to launch me didn't check if was ready, but I was anyway.   Seems significant. Things got really boring.  I was in an old car with red leather upholstery as a passenger with a group I worked with many years ago in Government (women).   We were driving around Hobart but it resembled an older larger city.   It was daytime but appeared to be early evening, the lighting was very soft and misty.   There were a lot of waterways.    Stories of romantic tragedy were being recounted and for some reason, something that stood out in my mind, I had a surprise realisation about a former colleague's sexual preferences.   Some plain clothes policemen were helpful (can't remember what with), we ate lunch and visited my former workplace (government building) and I just felt like I'd outgrown the people and the circumstances.",#cccccc,user2@test.com
2/3/2013,"Most of the night was a struggle sleeping, early on in and out of consciousness, I remember a bird, a pigeon, which was in a dream and then waking to the sound of one, or the other way round. The conscious embedding in the dream consciousness and vice versa.   This happened a few times early in the night, unfortunately I tossed and turned a lot.   My stomach was rumbling a lot.   Early on I had a fragment of a dream, with an old coke bottle in it.  standing in an old office in what was a coke factory.  Dave and I were talking about place, earlier in the evening, and within the conversation I mentioned coke for a split second.   Another fragment, was Joy Belle leaving art school, but not leaving art school  Instead she was leaving into a void, a middle dark grey void.   Like she was going overseas, but she wasn't, jut leaving into what seemed like the infinite unknown emptiness or nothingness.   Last week she had a PhD exhibition...Final fragment, consisted of being in a small room, like an old 1950s office with venetian blinds on the interior windows, no view on the outside, just me on lights.  That felt like a back room of a large factory.     I was trying to upload information onto a website info about an old rare secondhand record, a 1950s rock country style album, can't remember the name.   It took me some time, trying to work this out.  Once I thought I had it uploaded I checked the webpage and one after another, new listings appeared, fast, uneven, in broken view, nothing was lining up properly.   They came up sporadically but they were in faded black and white, like an Alexandre Singh.    On the page...Each record was listed at a ridiculously high price.  The last one I looked at and remember was rolling stones album.   I dreamt this kind of dream many times before, sifting through record bins finding whacky , old records, but never rolling stones, and never online before.  Always me buying rather than me selling.   They were very short, gritty, down to earth, practical reams in faded grey tones.",#cccccc,user3@test.com
2/3/2013,"Dave was describing how to get to this house......I was taking the windy road, sun shining past a lake, forest on the left stopped at a small hat surrounded by sunflowers, and this very effervescent woman gave me directions.   I continued on then the dream became about a man, his ex-wife, his lover, and his two children.   They were both boys....The dream introduced these characters like watching a soap opera....after a while wording about the characters he realised he has to choose....he still has feelings for the wife and the lover, much angst amongst the characters....then edited like a film, cut to sometime in the future, ex wife at the front door, someone's cleaning car in driveway...she's calling to him.    The question I had in my head was 'is it the husband'....a teenage boy sticks his head out.....no the son's are growing up, he chose the lover.   Cut to the man and the lover, older, happy to together.    Then the story moves to the beach and the couple have become Geoffrey rush and his lover, a younger man, slight with dark hair.   They are lying on the beach together, crazy busy, a happy vibe.  A plump woman is on my lap, we are laughing , having a good time.   We are laughing at people inside these plastic trampolines like the round ones you see in peoples backyards, but plastic ins instead fhte ... they have labels on the outside like fat and skinny.    five of them but I can't remember the titles.   People are jumping up and down, falling over, having fun inside them.   One of the characters at first it seems as though its Geoffrey Rush's lover, comes to show us his sore dick.   Then I realise he is a different character, a friend, and I get the feeling he doesn't get much sex, happy for him getting some.  Sore dick alright.   Then I see some girls in highschool f formal dresses, silvery blue on the beach, then I see them from above they are falling, skydiving together in their formal dresses....All holding onto a 4 handled trophy cup....they are all falling and squealing together but having fun, they land on the beach.   In the background the whole time, was playing Louis Armstrong singing a wonderful world.",#cccccc,user4@test.com
2/3/2013,"All out dream people are in a big house, its not the mansion, but I can't see everybody but I know they're all with me.  We're looking out the window, out on the lawn is bicycles scattered everywhere, abandoned in a hurry, everybody has run away, a big storm coming, storm approaching   Several storms pass, each worse than the last, and we're all safe inside, watching the rain and the ice on the window....We notice the black clouds are forming into strange shapes as they approach, then turn into digital, pixelated clouds, weird lettering, but unrecognisable, geometric....Elsewhere in the dream before that an dafter that, travelling in a 5 foot long dinky, rolls Royce, driving thorough traffic past real cars, feeling a bit of a fool as I see real cars, every now and then had to stop and carry it up some steps, bit heavy to pick up but I manage to , then keep driving.

2/3/2013,"In an urban environment like a at night, near Hobart mall, in a car with a bunch of boys (younger self) but husband in car, don't see his face, TV character I do see the face of, in box set.  They are all young, yelling stuff being delinquent.....and then we drove up a steep road, changed cars, in car with husband, driving he was passenger, kids in back, drove up steep road, 10 in old house, out the front of old house, had been running.    The occupants of the car changed... girlfriend's house had been burgled, it was night again...outside near my vegie patch near my house, but driveway was old neighbours driveway, quite steep , apparently he was supposed to have a gargage sale but nothing to sell, only person came was old man....some reason got upset, ran into a chook shed and hid behind door (chook shed not usually there)...next door neighbour came down the garden and was really upset because it had a dog, but with a sheep's face.  I said she had to leave because having the dog there would upset the bunnies and chickens...Friend of mine, they'd been looking at the futon (worried) but I knew she met hen, but something was wrong with one of our chickens. 'Angela they've been looking at the futon for a while, you need to come inside now because'.....(then I woke up with the sense it had died).",#cccccc,user6@test.com
2/3/2013,"We are running the 'dream matrix' and I am upstairs with a lot of girls (kind of like the Mansion) and David is downstairs preparing the workshop.   He has everyone in a militaristic kind of arrangement and he himself is a bit militaristic as he lines everyone up for yoga.    He starts the class by getting everyone to do hip rotations, imagining they 'are having filthy sex'.   I look at him thinking 'that's a bit inappropriate for yoga' and wonder if I should take over the class...I am in a classroom situation and sitting right up the front before a teacher who is part man/part wolf.    He has a large animal headpiece on and a hat and I am trying to balance the hat on his head, and also stroking his chin like a dog or cat thinking how lovely he is.    I am just waiting for the lesson to begin",#cccccc,user7@test.com
2/3/2013,"Cake - 'it's not just a lump of dry ingredients'....Three stories deep, underground, naked walls covered in pipes, KK standing on a pipe in shiny gumboots....Spider web, black spider with silly fluffy blue head....Shoes - with a hand-written swing tag that says ‘You're good to go now'....Purple & yellow bees, in home made bee suits....Trying to push a big heavy BBQ and gas bottle up a rocky steep hill - that's impossible I'm not helping you do that....KK laughing says she always has so much vanilla....The sound of the river lapping - you really can't stay here with me....Yo lander Jabbey. He's a great writer....Wash coffee flavored potatoes  "they taste like tira mì su"....Pigeon pooping out punctuation",#cccccc,user8@test.com
6/3/2013,"Back at old house in Belton street (had bought it again)....Side fence had been removed, gravel path replaced with concrete. Very dry grass, a bit unkempt. Retaining wall at front made from Bessel blocks added which I didn't like....Something about tree at front - grown too large? Tangled in wires? My mother sweeping up - noticed she had swept in front of retaining wall....Up the side (between my house and next door) was grass lane way, a couple of cars zoomed down it, which annoyed me. Then a motorbike which wobbled a bit, running over the edge of the lane, and then fell over. It was an older Japanese bike, and the rider seemed large, wearing a grey jacket, workmanlike rather than sharp or glamorous...Ran to where the bike had crashed with some other people and, when they took their helmet off, the rider turned out to be Olivia from TIO. She was groggy, maybe concussed & I invited her to lie down inside. In front room there was a couch similar to the old green one I used to have which folded into a bed. In the dream, this folded into a narrow bed at right-angles to the direction of couch, which seemed strange. Olivia lay down on the bed, but I was vaguely worried that you shouldn't go to sleep with concussion because you might not wake up....Then I went outside again and began to notice that it was as if a lot of the work I had previously done to the house hadn't happened. Things that I had repaired, like down pipes, weren't fixed. Construction I had done was back the way it was before. But particularly the painting I had done - the walls were still the old cream and patchy rather than maroon....I couldn't understand this (how had the last owners removed or changed the work I had done?) and tried to convey the mystery to a woman who I had lived there with before - she was a combination of Julie-Ann and Kath maybe, but not really like either of them. She either didn't believe me or didn't think it was important, which made me angry as I kept trying to get her to take me seriously....Then I was in the garage at my parents' house where I grew up, trying to convince someone (John K from the ACMA?) connected with the media about the significance of the fact that renovation work I had done was now not done. It was as though this was a mysterious or unexplained phenomenon.",#cccccc,user9@test.com
