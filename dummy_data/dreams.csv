"I had a dream of a friend of my father's whose been very kind to me since my father died, I'll call him Jim [not his real name]. In the dream I was laying in bed, I was with Jim, he had his arms around me, and he kept saying, ""Oh, its so good to have you back in my arms again."" That's all that he kept saying. It was funny, because it wasn't a sexual dream, it was more a comfort dream, it was comforting to be with him and the senses I used were three of course; hearing, I could hear him talking to me, touch, I could feel his arms around me, and the mattress and the bedding, and smell, I could smell his cologne.

"I had a weird sort of dream, I was stuck somewhere, in a doctor's office, like in an exam room, waiting for a long time and then I left. The whole office had a sort of maroon carpeting and looked like it had been a really big house at some point or something and then I walked out of the exam, the whole office, I was wandering around this big long hall and it was carpeted the same way and it had big huge windows lining the whole hall I think on both sides, and it looked kind of late out, not like real sunny and I guess I was there a really long time because a nurse came out from the doctor's office and said that I'd been there a really long time and did I have a ride home, and I suddenly realized that I didn't, that I hadn't made arrangements with the patient transport [company] to go home and that it was after 5 and I couldn't and besides, I needed 24 hours notice. And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend ""I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone"" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said ""there's a phone right here"". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, ""nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here"" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying ""I want to go home, I want to go home"" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought that she was thinking that I was crazy for acting like a little kid.

"I had made an appointment with my hairdresser to get a permanent. I went there and the hairdresser said that there were some changes. I sat down in the chair and she pushed a button somewhere and these scissors came out of the wall I think, and began to cut my hair. They were automatic. They would cut for so long and then they would stop. I could hear this noise, this motor, I guess they were going back into the wall or wherever they came from.

I did and the dryer was there and she pushed a button and the dryer came on and dried my hair off. Of course she had shampooed it first and put all that gunk in it.

Then she said come over to this part of the room and I went and she brought me over to another machine and she said ""put your head back."" There was no sink there or anything like there usually is. Then this lotion came out from this place in the wall I guess. When it was over, she said that she wanted to give me a blow cut so I had to go back to the dryer again. In real life my hairdresser does all these things herself but in the dream it was all done automatically. I don't know if she had robots or what.

And I watched it sail off over the horizon, over the most beautiful bluish-green ocean and brilliant blue sky and turned around and walked away and was in some kind of field or meadow where this very, very tall lamppost with 4 lights coming out of the top of it very oddly shaped, I can't describe the shape and the lights were pointed in the 4 directions of the compass, north, south, east and west and they were on, they were bright but very, very pretty.

We came in and she was getting something out of a cupboard. She was wearing a bright red dress, and she has very short, very black hair and very trim, neat little figure and this bright red dress just enhanced her looks and all of a sudden a great big dog came around the corner and F said ""oh, I brought my dog"" and the dog came up to me and rubbed against me and I said to it ""oh I bet you're hungry, I bet you haven't been fed"". I had a can of dog food in the refrigerator, opened, with part of it taken out, I have no idea where that came from because I don't have a dog. I can remember saying to them, that I'm really not much of an animal lover, but this is a beautiful dog. I turned around and we chatted and I made plans to go up to the VA hospital, and I asked if we could stop and eat breakfast along the way and the answer was a very solid ""No, we won't have time"" and I was bitterly disappointed.

And these women were telling me that I had to move all my stuff out, because they had a housing shortage and in the housing lottery I had drawn a place to live, but it was a tent in the parking lot and I was really, really upset because it was going to be winter soon and it was getting to be cold, and besides, I was in the room that I had been in all along and it was nice and I wanted to stay there and I told them: ""Look, you better see what you can do because I'm arthritic and I can't live outside, even in a tent, especially in winter I just can't.""

I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too.

It was up to me and my supervisor said if there was only one service that the person needed then J could stay in her home, but I was trying to figure out stuff like whether she could see the blackboard and so I said that I would have to talk to her and find out what she wants to do. So I was working in my dream and I said ""oh, well, I better get this form done for Q by September 30th because they have to have it by the end of the fiscal year"".

"This dream involved guide dog school. Somehow I was at my parents' old house and we were sitting on the front porch and a lady came up and asked how did I get home every day, at what time did I get off the bus, then I said that I don't take the bus, once in a while I take the bus, but most of the time I don't take the bus, at first I couldn't remember how I got home and then I remembered that I took a taxi home, but somehow I couldn't figure out how I did that because somehow I was stuck at Redwood school, where I attended when I was a kid and it didn't seem to have anything to do with working. I knew that I usually walked to work like I do now and so I was all mixed up trying to answer her question, it seemed like an unusually difficult question, very confused. Then I was at guide dog school and there were all these people who it seemed were waiting to be evaluated for guide dogs. There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some unknown reason, I had to get up early and I said that I was going to walk around down here, its so nice, it was a countryish setting and I was going to walk around.
